# Machine-Predictive-Maintenance-Project
This project investigates machine failure prediction using data preprocessing, analysis, and statistical study. It explores failure types, tool wearâ€™s impact on failure risk, and models machine failures. The work includes data cleaning, modeling, evaluation, and innovative insights to optimize maintenance scheduling and reduce downtime.
