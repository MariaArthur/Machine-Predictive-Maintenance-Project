# 🛠️ Machine Predictive Maintenance

This project applies Machine Learning techniques for Predictive Maintenance using sensor data. The objective is to predict potential equipment failures before they occur, minimizing downtime and maintenance costs.

## 🔍 Overview
- Built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
- Uses labeled machine condition monitoring data.
- Includes preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 📊 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification models to predict failure status
- Visualization of performance metrics (confusion matrix, ROC curve)
- Data cleaning and handling missing values

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost (optional)

## 📁 Files
- `machine_predictive_maintenance.ipynb` — main notebook with all the steps
- `README.md` — project overview

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `machine_predictive_maintenance.ipynb` in Jupyter
3. Run all cells to see the results
